                <h1>New polls show Donald Trump in prime position to sweep up the next 2 key states</h1>
                <p>Polls released Wednesday found presidential frontrunners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on track to pull out wins in the crucial states of Florida and Ohio next week.</p>

                <p>In Florida, a new CNN/ORC poll showed Trump ahead of Sen. Marco Rubio 40% to 24% in the Republican race. A Wednesday Quinnipiac poll had Trump ahead of Rubio by 23 points in the senator's home state.</p>

                <p>The CNN poll found that Clinton held a 27-point lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the Democratic side in the Sunshine State.</p>

                <p>In Ohio, the CNN poll had Trump leading John Kasich — the state's governor — by 6 points. Quinnipiac found Trump leading by the same 6-point margin.</p>

                <p>And the CNN poll showed Clinton, the former secretary of state, up on Sanders by 30 points in Ohio.</p>

                <p>All the polls were conducted before Tuesday night's contests. Trump won three of four states on the GOP side, further paving his path to the nomination. But Sanders pulled off perhaps the biggest stunner of the election cycle, beating Clinton in Michigan.</p>

                <p>The surveys displayed the critical nature of the states to Kasich and Rubio, who are vying to become the prime alternative to Trump. A vast majority of voters in Ohio and Florida said their home-state candidates should drop out if they failed to win their state. The CNN survey showed that 71% of Ohioans thought Kasich should end his campaign if he were to lose Ohio, while 66% said Rubio needed to give up if he did not win Florida.</p>
