                <h1>These 2 charts show why the shipping industry might be screwed</h1>
                <p>It's no secret that China's growth is slowing. Just a week ago the country's Premier, Li Keqiand, told the National People's Congress China's growth target for 2016 would be revised down to 6.5%-7%. In 2014 it was 7.4%.</p>

                <p>A difference of less than 1% may not sound like a lot, but for "capesize" shipping companies – companies which lease ships of over 150 tonnes to transport raw materials – it's proving to be a big deal.</p>

                <p>Bloomberg has written a report which explains what a sorry state the shipping industry is in, and two charts in particular really hit home how bad things are.</p>

                <p>The first shows how much earnings have dropped for leasing a capesize ship:</p>

                <p>At this point, you might think shipping companies just have too many ships and should sell off their surplus. But again we have the same problem: vessels are now worth less than ever. In fact their value is almost 50% less than their peak in 2014.</p>
