                <h1>Hillary Clinton shouldn't panic after her stunning Michigan loss â€” but here's what she should worry about</h1>
                <p>For more than a year, one of my favorite talking points about Hillary Clinton has been that her negatives are "priced in."</p>

                <p>After nearly four decades of controversies around her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, people have already decided whether they trust her, and they won't be moved by new stories about her email server or Benghazi talking points or anything else.</p>

                <p>And while her support for the Iraq War was a negative for Democratic voters, the polls indicated that they had decided to forgive her for it.</p>

                <p>The surprising and persistent success of the Bernie Sanders campaign showed that I was wrong: Many of Clinton's fans could be persuaded to vote for someone else.</p>

                <p>Sanders managed to do so in large part by focusing on two issues on which Clinton had not been previously attacked much: Wall Street, and the concern that Clinton is too cozy with it, as exemplified by her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs; and free trade, which Clinton has intermittently supported.</p>
