                <h1>WeWork is now a $16 billion company</h1>
                <p>Office-sharing startup WeWork is raising $430 million in new funding that places it at around a $16 billion valuation.</p>

                <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Fortune had pegged the deal at a $780 million investment at a $17 billion valuation, but a person close to the deal provided Business Insider with more accurate figures.</p>

                <p>In a blog entry, WeWork shared that the investors leading the deal were Chinese firms Legend Holdings and Hony Capital — giving the super-hot office-rental company a foot in the door in China.</p>

                <p>WeWork, which has already raised $969 million in funding at a $10 billion valuation, was already the 11th most valuable startup in the world without accounting for this round.</p>

                <p>The last we heard of WeWork, in November 2015, it was reportedly going after $750 million in debt financing — basically, a loan. It's not clear if WeWork ever actually went through with that move.</p>

                <p>Debt financing is structured like a loan to be paid back later, while equity means the lender gets a piece of the company. This round, confirmed by court forms reportedly filed on Tuesday and spotted by VC Experts, would be for equity.</p>

                <p>WeWork now has 80 coworking spaces in 23 cities around the globe. WeWork's 50,000 clients range from startups — Business Insider uses a WeWork space out in San Francisco — to big companies like Merck and American Express. Individuals can also buy packages starting at $45 and rent a desk for a day.</p>
