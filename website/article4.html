                <h1>39 of the most hilariously bad texts people have sent their exes</h1>
                <p>"Texts from your ex" is a wildly popular Instagram account that chronicles the bad texts we, as a society, send our former flames.</p>

                <p>From drunken awkwardness to tragic pleading, this stream of (allegedly) real texts, sent in by fans, has snagged 1.8 million followers. It even has a book.</p>

                <p>The account was founded by Elan Gale, one of the producers of TV show "The Bachelor." In some ways, this Instagram account is exactly like his show: We aren't sure how much of it is "real," but it captures something about humanity, and it's definitely entertaining.</p>
